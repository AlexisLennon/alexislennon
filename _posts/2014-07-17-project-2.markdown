description: The skylight in my Axolotl space is inspired by big aquariums and greenhouses. The skylight was built in my first modded Minecraft world and it took a lot of measuring and planning when I mined it out. I decided to essentially build a tower from the ground of the enclosure to the top of the roof. I think I could have probably found a better, more efficient way to do it but in the end it got finished. I later rounded off the edge to allow for a better view of the sky when viewing from the side.
